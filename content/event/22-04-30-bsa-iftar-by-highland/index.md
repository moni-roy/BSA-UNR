abstract: "The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is officially underway, with many Muslims around the world fasting for the next few weeks. Those who are taking part eat two times a day, before sunrise, in a meal known as Suhoor or Sehri, and after sunset, in a meal known as Iftari or Iftar. 

We, the BSA community want to arrange an iftar party on April 30, 2022 (Saturday) for our Bangladeshi Student community.
