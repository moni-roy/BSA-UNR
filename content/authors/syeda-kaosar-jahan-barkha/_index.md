I believe there is no boundaries to achieve one's goal, if a person has that willpower along with luck! Professionally, I am very much interested in Development Economics or to be more specific Health Economics, as I believe this area demonstrates both a vast variety of research and the potential to improve policies for the developing countries. I want to make significant contributions in the arena of development economics of Bangladesh, which I will immensely enjoy being a Bangladeshi!
