I am graduate student currently doing my M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering with a specialization in Earthquake and Structural Engineering in UNR. Before that, I have been working as an Assistant Structural Engineer at Young Engineers: a construction-consultancy company situated in Chattogram, Bangladesh. My BS was from Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Sylhet.

In the research realm, I am very passionate about applications of modern technologies for futuristic Civil and Structural Engineering to make them more ""Smart"". As a result, my primary research interest focuses on Health Monitoring of Civil Infrastructures, especially in optimizing and designing wired or wireless sensor layouts, parameter identification, model updating, fault detection and damage prognosis. I am also interested in sophisticated tools and techs like deep learning, data mining, AI and ML are available to develop a system for detecting global to local damages. I am now working on the path to developing a state-of-art monitoring technique using aerial robots.
