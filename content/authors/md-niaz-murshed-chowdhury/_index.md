I am a Ph.D. (Econometrics and Quantitative Economics) candidate at the University of Nevada Reno and my expected graduation date is in August of 2022. I received my B.S.S. from the University of Chittagong in economics. I also received an M.S.S. in that same subject from the same university. Later I received an M.S. in that subject from South Dakota State University, USA. I am a researcher in the field of Environmental and Resource Economics at the Department of Economics and Cooperative Extension at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research explores the pattern and drivers of land use and land cover dynamics, the ecological impacts of changing climates, landscapes, wildlife management, wildland restoration, and the implication of these changes for ecosystem services. My previous research has examined drivers of land-use change and land-use conversion decision in the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States, spatial analysis, spatial econometrics, survey design and implementation, non-market valuation, the transition of assets and management of next-generation South Dakota Producers, renewable and non-renewable resource analysis management of Bangladesh, economics growth dynamics in the United States and Bangladesh, investigation of the determinants of foreign exchange reserve and inflation, and economic development analysis in the less developed countries. â€‹My research has been strongly interdisciplinary, affording me the opportunity to collaborate with applied. economists, climatologist, Geo-spatial scientist, ecologists from South Dakota State University, North Dakota State University, Michigan State University, and Iowa State University with varying complementary backgrounds and skill sets. My work has been cited in excess of 241 times by researchers from all over the world, including research groups at major national institutions such as the USDA, ARS Official, the U.S Geological Survey at the Earth Resources and Observation Science Center (EROS), Farm Management Department, Atmosphere and Environmental research, the International Center for Climate and Global Change Research, the American Association for the Advancement Science, the U.S. Geological Survey, and South Dakota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit.
