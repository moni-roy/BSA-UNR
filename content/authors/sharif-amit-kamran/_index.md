Hi, I'm Amit, a fourth year PhD Candidate in CS at University of Nevada Reno. I am currently working as a Data, Analytics and Imaging at Roche/Genentech Inc. for Summer 2022. I have also worked as Product Development Intern at Genentech Inc. from May till December 2021.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Medical Image Processing. I have been working on improving robustness, image synthesis, and image denoising using Semi-supervised and Self-supervised GAN on different modalities of Ophthalmological and Calcium imaging data. The projects are funded by NASA, NIH and DoD.

Other than that, my activities include listening to extreme metal music, participating in e-sports tournaments (CS:GO, Dota 2) and traveling new places.
