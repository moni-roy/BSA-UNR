abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is considered to be an effective privacy-preservation method to secure the promising distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm-federated learning (FL) from privacy attacks (e.g., membership inference attack). Nevertheless, while the DP mechanism greatly alleviates privacy concerns, recent studies have shown that it can be exploited to conduct security attacks (e.g., false data injection attacks). To address such attacks on FL-based applications in critical infrastructures, in this paper, we perform the first systematic study on the DP-exploited poisoning attacks from an adversarial point of view. We demonstrate that the DP method, despite providing a level of privacy guarantee, can effectively open a new poisoning attack vector for the adversary. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of a smart grid dataset show the FL performance degradation (sub-optimal model generation) scenario due to the differential noise-exploited selective model poisoning attacks. As a countermeasure, we propose a reinforcement learning-based differential privacy level selection (rDP) process. The rDP process utilizes the differential privacy parameters (privacy loss, information leakage probability, etc.) and the losses to intelligently generate an optimal privacy level for the nodes. The evaluation shows the accumulated reward and errors of the proposed technique converge to an optimal privacy policy.
