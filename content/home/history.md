The thought of establishing a Bangladeshi-based student organization at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) was conceived by (Dr.) Mokter Hossain with the active involvement, encouragement, and support of Dr. Muhammed Quddus (dearly called Mama). The first meeting between the two took place on a cool April morning in the corner of a hallway of the College of Education building. The primary idea was for the UNR students of Bangladeshi descent to have a seat at the table at the University’s extracurricular campus life. 

The association came into being in 2012 with a handful of students numbering about five. Dr. Quddus was tasked with the writing of the bylaws which the student members of the time unanimously approved. The organization was enrolled with the University the same year as Bangladeshi Student Association (BSA).

While its founder Dr. Mokter Hossain, and then students have moved on to opportunities elsewhere around the country, today’s Bangladeshi Student Association remains a vibrant part of UNR’s sprawling campus. BSA maintains a robust presence at the campus through its participation in university-sponsored forums like the Night of All Nations (NOA), and Bangladesh-specific events such as the Pahela Baishak, Ekushe February, Shadhinata Dibosh, and the like.
