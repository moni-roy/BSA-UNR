Hi!

We are planning to celebrate our country's (Bangladesh) independence day, which is on 26th March 2022 (Saturday) from our Bangladeshi Student community. In addition, we will celebrate our Bengali New Year on the same day at the same venue with the same people from our community and others. These two festivals are kind of two major events for our community. Therefore, we are very excited to arrange this program.

We are expecting around 100 people to be gathered for this program including some of our friends from different countries and cultures.

Moreover, we will arrange a musical event as a part of our program.

Since the musical event might require a stage, we are looking forward to reserving the Wells Fargo Auditorium in the knowledge center from 26th March 2022 11:30 AM to 5:30 PM including the cleaning time.

Please note that we will not serve food inside, rather the guests will take their food outside from the lobby or other places.

Please let us know if you can arrange the auditorium for us for our most awaited event. Also, if you need any more details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks and Regards
